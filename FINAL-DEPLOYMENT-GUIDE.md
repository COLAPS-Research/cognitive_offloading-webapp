## 👥 **Participant Recruitment & Management**

### **Recruitment URLs**
Share these links with participants:

**Treatment Condition:**
```
http://localhost:3000/experiment?experimentId=YOUR_EXPERIMENT_ID&mode=treatment
```

**Control Condition:**  
```
http://localhost:3000/experiment?experimentId=YOUR_EXPERIMENT_ID&mode=control
```

### **Sample Recruitment Email**
```
Subject: Learning & Memory Research Study - 45 min + follow-up

Dear [Name],

You're invited to participate in a research study examining how different learning methods affect memory and cognitive effort.

**What's involved:**
• Session 1: 45 minutes (learning tasks + questionnaires)  
• Session 2: 15 minutes (follow-up memory test in 48-72 hours)

**Compensation:** [Your compensation details]

**Study Link:** [Insert appropriate condition URL above]

The study helps us understand optimal learning strategies and contributes to educational research.

Questions? Contact: [Your contact information]

Best regards,
[Your name and affiliation]
```

### **Counterbalancing Strategy**
1. **Manual Assignment**: Alternate URLs for odd/even participants
2. **Block Randomization**: Assign 10 treatment, then 10 control, repeat
3. **Automated**: Modify registration to randomly assign conditions

## 📊 **Real-Time Monitoring During Data Collection**

### **Behavioral Analytics Dashboard**
Access at: Research Dashboard > "🧠 Behavioral Analytics"

#### **Key Metrics to Monitor:**
- **Participation Rates**: Total enrolled vs. completed
- **Cognitive Offloading**: Hint usage, audio replays, modal time
- **Mental Effort**: Paas ratings (1-9 scale) mid-task vs. post-task
- **Learning Performance**: Immediate vs. delayed recall accuracy
- **Data Quality**: Completion times, outlier detection

#### **Red Flags to Watch For:**
- ⚠️ **Very fast completion times** (< 20 minutes) - possible non-engagement
- ⚠️ **No hint usage in treatment** - participants may not understand interface
- ⚠️ **Uniform Paas ratings** - scale misunderstanding
- ⚠️ **High dropout rates** - task difficulty or technical issues

## 🔬 **Data Analysis Pipeline**

### **Automated Data Export**
The system automatically calculates:
- **Accuracy Scores**: Normalized Levenshtein distance (0-1 scale)
- **Behavioral Metrics**: Objective measures of cognitive offloading
- **Mental Effort**: Paas scale ratings with timing context
- **Performance Differences**: Immediate vs. delayed recall

### **Key Research Questions You Can Answer:**

1. **Main Effect**: Do treatment participants show better delayed recall than control?
2. **Mediation**: Does mental effort mediate the generation effect?
3. **Moderation**: Does prior knowledge interact with condition effects?
4. **Behavioral**: Do cognitive offloading patterns predict learning outcomes?

### **Statistical Analysis Template (R)**
```r
# Your data exports as CSV with all necessary variables
library(tidyverse)
library(mediation)

# Load data
results <- read_csv("experiment_results.csv")
events <- read_csv("behavioral_events.csv")

# Main effect analysis  
model1 <- lm(delayed_accuracy ~ condition + prior_knowledge, data = results)

# Mediation analysis
med_model <- mediate(
  model.m = lm(mental_effort ~ condition, data = results),
  model.y = lm(delayed_accuracy ~ condition + mental_effort, data = results),
  treat = "condition", 
  mediator = "mental_effort"
)
```

## 📅 **Delayed Recall Management**

### **Automatic Link Generation**
When participants complete Session 1:
- System automatically generates secure 48-72hr follow-up links
- Links stored in database with participant ID
- Console logs the URLs for manual distribution

### **Manual Follow-Up Process**
1. **After 48 hours**: Send participants their unique delayed recall links
2. **Participants access**: Links are valid for 24-hour window after 48hr mark
3. **Automatic scoring**: System calculates delayed accuracy upon completion

### **Bulk Link Generation** (Optional)
For larger studies, use API endpoint:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/v1/delayed-recall/generate-bulk-links \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"participantIds": ["id1", "id2"], "experimentId": "exp_id", "delayHours": 48}'
```

## 📈 **Expected Research Outcomes**

### **Primary Hypotheses You Can Test:**
1. **Generation Effect**: Treatment > Control for delayed recall
2. **Cognitive Load**: Treatment participants report higher mental effort
3. **Offloading Behavior**: Treatment participants use more hints/support
4. **Prior Knowledge Interaction**: Generation effect stronger for familiar words

### **Novel Contributions:**
- **Objective Behavioral Measures**: Real-time cognitive offloading tracking
- **Ecologically Valid**: Web-based learning environment
- **Process-Focused**: Mental effort as mediator, not just outcome
- **Methodologically Rigorous**: Proper baseline separation, counterbalancing
