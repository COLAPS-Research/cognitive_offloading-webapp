# Cognitive Learning Study Web Application

A comprehensive web application implementing research on **active answer generation vs system-provided answers** for learning and retention, with focus on cognitive load and cognitive offloading behaviors.

## üß† Research Framework

Based on established cognitive psychology principles:

- **Generation Effect & Desirable Difficulties**: Active generation boosts long-term retention but depends on prior knowledge
- **Cognitive Load Theory**: Measured subjectively via Paas scale and interpreted relative to task demands  
- **Cognitive Offloading**: Measured as in-task behavior (hint usage, support seeking) not just post-hoc questionnaires

### Core Variables
- **IV**: Condition ‚Äî Self-generated answers (treatment) vs System-provided answers (control)
- **DV**: Immediate recall (transcription) and delayed recall (48‚Äì72hrs spelling test)
- **Mediator**: Subjective mental effort (Paas scale), measured mid-task and post-task
- **Behavioral Measures**: Keystroke counts, time on task, hint reveals, audio replays

## üéØ Implemented Features

### ‚úÖ Core Task Flow
1. **Prior Knowledge Baseline Assessment** - Separate measurement before manipulation
2. **Gap-Fill Task** with audio story playback and target word blanks
3. **Correction Modal** with condition-specific behavior:
   - **Treatment**: Wordle-style letter feedback, progressive hints, forced explanation
   - **Control**: Immediate answer reveal with optional explanation
4. **Transcription Task** for immediate recall measurement
5. **Paas Mental Effort Scale** at mid-task and post-task points
6. **Delayed Recall System** (48-72hr window, scheduled)

### ‚úÖ Behavioral Data Collection
- Real-time keystroke counting and timing
- Audio replay counts and interaction patterns  
- Hint usage tracking and progressive reveal system
- Attempt counting and error patterns
- Time-on-task measurements per component

### ‚úÖ Experimental Controls
- Counterbalanced condition assignment
- Randomized word order in delayed testing
- Proper separation of prior knowledge from manipulation
- Levenshtein distance scoring for spelling accuracy
